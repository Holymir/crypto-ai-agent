## Implementation Details

### AIInsights.jsx Changes

#### 1. Added React Router Navigation
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

#### 2. StatItem Component
```javascript
const handleClick = () => {
  const filterParam = {
    asset: 'asset',
    category: 'category',
    chain: 'chain'
  }[filterType];

  if (filterParam) {
    navigate(`/articles?${filterParam}=${encodeURIComponent(item.name)}`);
  }
};
```

**Props added:**
- `filterType`: "asset" | "category" | "chain"

#### 3. KeywordCloud Component
```javascript
const handleKeywordClick = (keyword) => {
  navigate(`/articles?search=${encodeURIComponent(keyword)}`);
};
```

### Articles.jsx Changes

#### 1. URL Query Parameter Support
```javascript
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

// Initialize from URL
const [selectedAsset, setSelectedAsset] = useState(searchParams.get('asset') || '');
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState(searchParams.get('category') || '');
const [selectedChain, setSelectedChain] = useState(searchParams.get('chain') || '');
```

#### 2. Enhanced Filter Badges
Each filter shows as a colored badge with X button:
- **Sentiment:** Purple
- **Search:** Blue
- **Asset:** Yellow
- **Category:** Cyan
- **Chain:** Pink

#### 3. Individual Clear Buttons
Each badge has its own X button to remove just that filter.

#### 4. Clear All Button
Clears all filters and resets URL:
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  setSearchTerm('');
  setSelectedSentiment('');
  setSelectedAsset('');
  setSelectedCategory('');
  setSelectedChain('');
  setSearchParams({});
}}
```
